# Attack Vectors Reference (2/5)

170 total attack vectors. For each: detection pattern and false-positive signals.

---

**35. Governance Flash-Loan Upgrade Hijack**

- **D:** Proxy upgrades via governance using current-block vote weight (`balanceOf` or `getPastVotes(block.number)`). No voting delay or timelock. Flash-borrow, vote, execute upgrade in one tx.
- **FP:** `getPastVotes(block.number - 1)`. Timelock 24-72h. High quorum thresholds. Staking lockup required.

**36. Proxy Storage Slot Collision**

- **D:** Proxy stores `implementation`/`admin` at sequential slots (0, 1); implementation also declares variables from slot 0. Implementation writes overwrite proxy pointers.
- **FP:** EIP-1967 randomized slots used. OZ Transparent/UUPS pattern.

**37. Solmate SafeTransferLib Missing Contract Existence Check**

- **D:** Protocol uses Solmate's `SafeTransferLib` for ERC20 transfers. Unlike OZ `SafeERC20`, Solmate does not verify target address contains code — `transfer`/`transferFrom` to an EOA or not-yet-deployed `CREATE2` address returns success silently, crediting a phantom deposit.
- **FP:** OZ `SafeERC20` used instead. Manual `require(token.code.length > 0)` check. Token addresses verified at construction/initialization.

**38. Unauthorized Peer Initialization (Fake Peer Attack)**

- **D:** `setPeer()` / `setTrustedRemote()` sets the remote peer address that a cross-chain contract trusts. If the owner is compromised or `setPeer` lacks proper access control, an attacker registers a fraudulent peer contract on the source chain that can mint/unlock tokens on the destination without legitimate deposits. Pattern: `setPeer` callable by non-owner, or owner key compromised.
- **FP:** `setPeer` protected by multisig + timelock. Peer addresses verified against known deployment registry. `allowInitializePath()` properly implemented to reject unknown peers. Ref: GAIN token exploit (Sep 2025) — fake peer minted 5B tokens, $3M stolen.

**39. Improper Flash Loan Callback Validation**

- **D:** `onFlashLoan` callback doesn't verify `msg.sender == lendingPool`, or doesn't check `initiator`/`token`/`amount`. Callable directly without real flash loan.
- **FP:** Both `msg.sender == address(lendingPool)` and `initiator == address(this)` validated. Token/amount checked.

**40. Multi-Block TWAP Oracle Manipulation**

- **D:** TWAP observation window < 30 minutes. Post-Merge validators controlling consecutive blocks can hold manipulated AMM state across blocks, shifting TWAP cheaply.
- **FP:** TWAP window >= 30 min. Chainlink/Pyth as price source. Max-deviation circuit breaker against secondary source.

**41. Missing Oracle Price Bounds (Flash Crash / Extreme Value)**

- **D:** Oracle returns a technically valid but extreme price (e.g., ETH at $0.01 during a flash crash). No min/max sanity bound or deviation check against historical/secondary price. Protocol executes liquidations or swaps at wildly incorrect prices.
- **FP:** Circuit breaker: `require(price >= MIN_PRICE && price <= MAX_PRICE)`. Deviation check against secondary oracle source. Heartbeat + price-change-rate limiting.

**42. Assembly Delegatecall Missing Return/Revert Propagation**

- **D:** Proxy fallback written in assembly performs `delegatecall` but omits one or more required steps: (1) not copying full calldata via `calldatacopy`, (2) not copying return data via `returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())`, (3) not branching on the result to `return(0, returndatasize())` on success or `revert(0, returndatasize())` on failure. Silent failures or swallowed reverts.
- **FP:** Complete proxy pattern: `calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())` → `delegatecall(gas(), impl, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)` → `returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())` → `switch result case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) } default { return(0, returndatasize()) }`. OZ Proxy.sol used.

**43. Function Selector Clash in Proxy**

- **D:** Proxy and implementation share a 4-byte selector collision. Call intended for implementation routes to proxy's function (or vice versa).
- **FP:** Transparent proxy pattern (admin/user call routing separates namespaces). UUPS with no custom proxy functions — all calls delegate unconditionally.

**44. Return Bomb (Returndata Copy DoS)**

- **D:** `(bool success, bytes memory data) = target.call(payload)` where `target` is user-supplied. Malicious target returns huge returndata; copying costs enormous gas.
- **FP:** Returndata not copied (assembly call without copy, or gas-limited). Callee is hardcoded trusted contract.

---

**45. Cross-Chain Deployment Replay**

- **D:** Deployment tx replayed on another chain. Same deployer nonce on both chains produces same CREATE address under different control. No EIP-155 chain ID protection. Ref: Wintermute.
- **FP:** EIP-155 signatures. `CREATE2` via deterministic factory at same address on all chains. Per-chain deployer EOAs.

**46. Chainlink Feed Deprecation / Wrong Decimal Assumption**

- **D:** (a) Chainlink aggregator address hardcoded/immutable with no update path — deprecated feed returns stale/zero price. (b) Assumes `feed.decimals() == 8` without runtime check — some feeds return 18 decimals, causing 10^10 scaling error.
- **FP:** Feed address updatable via governance. `feed.decimals()` called and used for normalization. Secondary oracle deviation check.

**47. UUPS `_authorizeUpgrade` Missing Access Control**

- **D:** `function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override {}` with empty body and no access modifier. Anyone can call `upgradeTo()`. Ref: CVE-2021-41264.
- **FP:** `_authorizeUpgrade()` has `onlyOwner` or equivalent. Multisig/governance controls owner role.

**48. Upgrade Race Condition / Front-Running**

- **D:** `upgradeTo(V2)` and post-upgrade config calls are separate txs in public mempool. Window for front-running (exploit old impl) or sandwiching between upgrade and config.
- **FP:** `upgradeToAndCall()` bundles upgrade + init. Private mempool (Flashbots Protect). V2 safe with V1 state from block 0. Timelock makes execution predictable.

**49. EIP-2612 Permit Front-Run DoS**

- **D:** `token.permit(...)` called inline in combined permit-and-action function without `try/catch`. Anyone can submit same permit first, incrementing nonce. Victim's subsequent call reverts permanently.
- **FP:** Permit wrapped in `try/catch`, falls through to pre-existing allowance. Permit is standalone call separate from action.

**50. Batch Distribution Dust Residual**

- **D:** Loop distributes funds proportionally: `share = total * weight[i] / totalWeight`. Cumulative rounding causes `sum(shares) < total`, leaving dust locked in contract. Pattern: N recipients each computed independently without remainder handling.
- **FP:** Last recipient gets `total - sumOfPrevious`. Dust swept to treasury. `mulDiv` with accumulator tracking. Protocol accepts bounded dust loss by design.

**51. ERC1155 setApprovalForAll Grants All-Token-All-ID Access**

- **D:** Protocol requires `setApprovalForAll(protocol, true)` for deposits/staking. No per-ID or per-amount granularity -- operator can transfer any ID at full balance.
- **FP:** Protocol uses direct `safeTransferFrom` with user as `msg.sender`. Operator is immutable contract with escrow-only transfer logic.

**52. Chainlink Staleness / No Validity Checks**

- **D:** `latestRoundData()` called but missing checks: `answer > 0`, `updatedAt > block.timestamp - MAX_STALENESS`, `answeredInRound >= roundId`, fallback on failure.
- **FP:** All four checks present. Circuit breaker or fallback oracle on failure.

**53. ERC1155 uri() Missing {id} Substitution**

- **D:** `uri(uint256 id)` returns fully resolved URL instead of template with literal `{id}` placeholder per EIP-1155. Clients expect to substitute zero-padded hex ID client-side. Static/empty return collapses all token metadata.
- **FP:** Returns string containing literal `{id}`. Or per-ID on-chain URI with documented deviation from substitution spec.

**54. ERC721 onERC721Received Arbitrary Caller Spoofing**

- **D:** `onERC721Received` uses parameters (`from`, `tokenId`) to update state without verifying `msg.sender` is the expected NFT contract. Anyone calls directly with fabricated parameters.
- **FP:** `require(msg.sender == address(nft))` before state update. Function is view-only or reverts unconditionally.

---

**55. Token Decimal Mismatch in Cross-Token Arithmetic**

- **D:** Cross-token math uses hardcoded `1e18` or assumes identical decimals. Pattern: collateral/LTV/rate calculations combining token amounts without per-token `decimals()` normalization.
- **FP:** Amounts normalized to canonical precision (WAD/RAY) using each token's `decimals()`. Explicit `10 ** (18 - decimals())` scaling. Protocol only supports tokens with identical verified decimals.

**56. Cross-Function Reentrancy**

- **D:** Two functions share state variable. Function A makes external call before updating shared state; Function B reads that state. `nonReentrant` on A but not B.
- **FP:** Both functions share same contract-level mutex. Shared state updated before any external call.

**57. L2 Sequencer Uptime Not Checked**

- **D:** Contract on L2 (Arbitrum/Optimism/Base) uses Chainlink feeds without querying L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed. Stale data during downtime triggers wrong liquidations.
- **FP:** Sequencer uptime feed queried (`answer == 0` = up), with grace period after restart.

**58. Counterfactual Wallet Initialization Parameters Not Bound to Deployed Address**

- **D:** Factory `createAccount` uses CREATE2 but salt doesn't incorporate all init params (especially owner). Attacker calls `createAccount` with different owner, deploying wallet they control to same counterfactual address.
- **FP:** Salt derived from all init params: `salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, ...))`. Factory reverts if account exists. Initializer called atomically with deployment.

**59. Transient Storage Low-Gas Reentrancy (EIP-1153)**

- **D:** Contract uses `transfer()`/`send()` (2300-gas) as reentrancy guard + uses `TSTORE`/`TLOAD`. Post-Cancun, `TSTORE` succeeds under 2300 gas unlike `SSTORE`. Second pattern: transient reentrancy lock not cleared at call end — persists for entire tx, causing DoS via multicall/flash loan callback.
- **FP:** `nonReentrant` backed by regular storage slot (or transient mutex properly cleared). CEI followed unconditionally.

**60. Stale Cached ERC20 Balance from Direct Token Transfers**

- **D:** Contract tracks holdings in state variable (`totalDeposited`, `_reserves`) updated only through protocol functions. Direct `token.transfer(contract)` inflates real balance beyond cached value. Attacker exploits gap for share pricing/collateral manipulation.
- **FP:** Accounting reads `balanceOf(this)` live. Cached value reconciled at start of every state-changing function. Direct transfers treated as revenue.

**61. msg.value Reuse in Loop / Multicall**

- **D:** `msg.value` read inside a loop or `delegatecall`-based multicall. Each iteration/sub-call sees the full original value — credits `n * msg.value` for one payment.
- **FP:** `msg.value` captured to local variable, decremented per iteration, total enforced. Function non-payable. Multicall uses `call` not `delegatecall`.

**62. ERC1155 totalSupply Inflation via Reentrancy Before Supply Update**

- **D:** `totalSupply[id]` incremented AFTER `_mint` callback. During `onERC1155Received`, `totalSupply` is stale-low, inflating caller's share in any supply-dependent formula. Ref: OZ GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx (2021).
- **FP:** OZ >= 4.3.2 (patched ordering). `nonReentrant` on all mint functions. No supply-dependent logic callable from mint callback.

**63. Oracle Price Update Front-Running**

- **D:** On-chain oracle update tx visible in mempool. Attacker front-runs a favorable price update by opening a position at the stale price, then profits when the update lands. Pattern: Pyth/Chainlink push-model where update tx is submitted to public mempool.
- **FP:** Protocol uses pull-based oracle (user submits price update atomically with their action). Private mempool (Flashbots Protect) for oracle updates. Price-update-and-action in single tx.

**64. ERC1155 Custom Burn Without Caller Authorization**

- **D:** Public `burn(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount)` callable by anyone without verifying `msg.sender == from` or operator approval. Any caller burns another user's tokens.
- **FP:** `require(from == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(from, msg.sender))` before `_burn`. OZ `ERC1155Burnable` used.

---

**65. OFT Shared Decimals Truncation (uint64 Overflow)**

- **D:** OFT converts between local decimals and shared decimals (typically 6). `_toSD()` casts to `uint64`. If `sharedDecimals >= localDecimals` (both 18), no decimal conversion occurs but the `uint64` cast silently truncates amounts exceeding ~18.4e18. Also: custom fee logic applied BEFORE `_removeDust()` produces incorrect fee calculations.
- **FP:** Standard OFT with `sharedDecimals = 6` and `localDecimals = 18` (default). Fee logic applied after dust removal. Transfer amounts validated against `uint64.max` before conversion.

**66. Blacklistable or Pausable Token in Critical Payment Path**

- **D:** Push-model transfer `token.transfer(recipient, amount)` with USDC/USDT or other blacklistable token. Blacklisted recipient reverts entire function, DOSing withdrawals/liquidations/fees.
- **FP:** Pull-over-push pattern (recipients withdraw own funds). Skip-on-failure `try/catch` on fee distribution. Token whitelist excludes blacklistable tokens.

**67. ERC721 Unsafe Transfer to Non-Receiver**

- **D:** `_transfer()`/`_mint()` used instead of `_safeTransfer()`/`_safeMint()`, sending NFTs to contracts without `IERC721Receiver`. Tokens permanently locked.
- **FP:** All paths use `safeTransferFrom`/`_safeMint`. Function is `nonReentrant`.

**68. Non-Standard ERC20 Return Values (USDT-style)**

- **D:** `require(token.transfer(to, amount))` reverts on tokens returning nothing (USDT, BNB). Or return value ignored (silent failure).
- **FP:** OZ `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()`/`safeTransferFrom()` used throughout.
