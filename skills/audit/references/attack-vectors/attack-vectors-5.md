# Attack Vectors Reference (5/5)

170 total attack vectors. For each: detection pattern and false-positive signals.

---

**137. Block Number as Timestamp Approximation**

- **D:** Time computed as `(block.number - startBlock) * 13` assuming fixed block times. Variable across chains/post-Merge. Wrong interest/vesting/rewards.
- **FP:** `block.timestamp` used for all time-sensitive calculations.

**138. Ordered Message Channel Blocking (Nonce DoS)**

- **D:** OApp uses ordered nonce execution. If one message permanently reverts on destination (e.g., recipient contract reverts, invalid state), ALL subsequent messages from that source are blocked. Attacker intentionally sends a poison message to freeze the entire channel.
- **FP:** Unordered nonce mode used (LayerZero V2 default). `_lzReceive` wrapped in try/catch with fallback logic. `NonblockingLzApp` pattern (V1). Admin can `skipPayload` / `clearPayload` to unblock. Ref: Code4rena Maia DAO finding #883.

**139. Beacon Proxy Single-Point-of-Failure Upgrade**

- **D:** Multiple proxies read implementation from single Beacon. Compromising Beacon owner upgrades all proxies at once. `UpgradeableBeacon.owner()` returns single EOA.
- **FP:** Beacon owner is multisig + timelock. `Upgraded` events monitored. Per-proxy upgrade authority where isolation required.

**140. Default Message Library Hijack (Configuration Drag-Along)**

- **D:** OApp does not explicitly pin its send/receive library version via `setSendVersion()` / `setReceiveVersion()` (or V2 `setSendLibrary()` / `setReceiveLibrary()`). It relies on the endpoint's mutable default. A malicious or compromised default library update silently applies to all unpinned OApps, bypassing DVN/Oracle validation.
- **FP:** OApp explicitly sets library versions in constructor or initialization. Configuration is immutable or governance-controlled with timelock. LayerZero V2 EndpointV2 is non-upgradeable (but library defaults are still mutable).

**141. Missing Chain ID Validation in Deployment Configuration**

- **D:** Deploy script reads `$RPC_URL` from `.env` without `eth_chainId` assertion. Foundry script without `--chain-id` flag or `block.chainid` check. No dry-run before broadcast.
- **FP:** `require(block.chainid == expectedChainId)` at script start. CI validates chain ID before deployment.

**142. Cross-Chain Supply Accounting Invariant Violation**

- **D:** The fundamental invariant `total_locked_source >= total_minted_destination` is violated. Can occur through: decimal conversion errors between chains, `_credit` callable without corresponding `_debit`, race conditions in multi-chain deployments, or any bug that allows minting without locking. Minted tokens become partially or fully unbacked.
- **FP:** Invariant verified via monitoring/alerting. `_credit` only callable from verified `lzReceive` path. Decimal conversion tested across all supported chains. Rate limits cap maximum exposure per time window.

**143. Unsafe Downcast / Integer Truncation**

- **D:** `uint128(largeUint256)` without bounds check. Solidity >= 0.8 silently truncates on downcast (no revert). Dangerous in price feeds, share calculations, timestamps.
- **FP:** `require(x <= type(uint128).max)` before cast. OZ `SafeCast` used.

**144. Storage Layout Collision Between Proxy and Implementation**

- **D:** Proxy declares state variables at sequential slots (not EIP-1967). Implementation also starts at slot 0. Proxy's admin overlaps implementation's `initialized` flag. Ref: Audius (2022).
- **FP:** EIP-1967 slots. OZ Transparent/UUPS pattern. No state variables in proxy contract.

**145. Merkle Proof Reuse — Leaf Not Bound to Caller**

- **D:** Merkle leaf doesn't include `msg.sender`: `MerkleProof.verify(proof, root, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(amount)))`. Proof can be front-run from different address.
- **FP:** Leaf encodes `msg.sender`: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount))`. Proof recorded as consumed after first use.

**146. Griefing via Dust Deposits Resetting Timelocks or Cooldowns**

- **D:** Timelock/cooldown resets on any deposit with no minimum: `lastActionTime[user] = block.timestamp` inside `deposit(uint256 amount)` without `require(amount >= MIN)`. Attacker calls `deposit(1)` to reset victim's lock indefinitely.
- **FP:** Minimum deposit enforced unconditionally. Cooldown resets only for depositing user. Lock assessed independently of deposit amounts per-user.

---

**147. Bytecode Verification Mismatch**

- **D:** Verified source doesn't match deployed bytecode behavior: different compiler settings, obfuscated constructor args, or `--via-ir` vs legacy pipeline mismatch. No reproducible build (no pinned compiler in config).
- **FP:** Deterministic build with pinned compiler/optimizer in committed config. Verification in deployment script (Foundry `--verify`). Sourcify full match. Constructor args published.

**148. ERC1155 onERC1155Received Return Value Not Validated**

- **D:** Custom ERC1155 calls `onERC1155Received` but doesn't check returned `bytes4` equals `0xf23a6e61`. Non-compliant recipient silently accepts tokens it can't handle.
- **FP:** OZ ERC1155 base validates selector. Custom impl explicitly checks return value.

**149. Dirty Higher-Order Bits on Sub-256-Bit Types**

- **D:** Assembly loads a value as a full 32-byte word (`calldataload`, `sload`, `mload`) but treats it as a smaller type (`address`, `uint128`, `uint8`, `bool`) without masking upper bits. Dirty bits cause incorrect comparisons, mapping key mismatches, or storage corruption. Pattern: `let addr := calldataload(4)` used directly without `and(addr, 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)`.
- **FP:** Explicit bitmask applied: `and(value, mask)` immediately after load. Value produced by a prior Solidity expression that already cleaned it. `shr(96, calldataload(offset))` pattern that naturally zeros upper bits for addresses.

**150. CREATE2 Address Squatting (Counterfactual Front-Running)**

- **D:** CREATE2 salt not bound to `msg.sender`. Attacker precomputes address and deploys first. For AA wallets: attacker deploys wallet to user's counterfactual address with attacker as owner.
- **FP:** Salt incorporates `msg.sender`: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, userSalt))`. Factory restricts deployer. Different owner in constructor produces different address.

**151. Invariant or Cap Enforced on One Code Path But Not Another**

- **D:** A constraint (pool cap, max supply, position limit, collateral ratio) is enforced during normal operation (e.g., `deposit()`) but not during settlement, reward distribution, interest accrual, or emergency paths. Constraint violated through the unguarded path.
- **FP:** Invariant check applied in a shared modifier/internal function called by all relevant paths. Post-condition assertion validates invariant after every state change. Comprehensive integration tests verify invariant across all entry points.

**152. Signed Integer Mishandling (signextend / sar / slt Confusion)**

- **D:** Assembly performs arithmetic on signed integers but uses unsigned opcodes. `shr` instead of `sar` (arithmetic shift right) loses the sign bit. `lt`/`gt` instead of `slt`/`sgt` treats negative numbers as huge positives. Missing `signextend` when loading a signed value smaller than 256 bits from calldata or storage.
- **FP:** Code consistently uses `sar`/`slt`/`sgt` for signed operations and `shr`/`lt`/`gt` for unsigned. `signextend(byteWidth - 1, val)` applied after loading sub-256-bit signed values. Code only operates on unsigned integers.

**153. Wrong Price Feed for Derivative or Wrapped Asset**

- **D:** Protocol uses ETH/USD feed to price stETH collateral, or BTC/USD feed for WBTC. During normal conditions the error is small, but during depeg events the mispricing enables undercollateralized borrows or incorrect liquidations.
- **FP:** Dedicated feed for the actual derivative asset (e.g., stETH/USD, WBTC/BTC). Deviation check against secondary oracle. Protocol documentation explicitly accepts depeg risk.

**154. tx.origin Authentication**

- **D:** `require(tx.origin == owner)` used for auth. Phishable via intermediary contract.
- **FP:** `tx.origin == msg.sender` used only as anti-contract check, not auth.

**155. ERC4626 Caller-Dependent Conversion Functions**

- **D:** `convertToShares()`/`convertToAssets()` branches on `msg.sender`-specific state (per-user fees, whitelist, balances). EIP-4626 requires caller-independence. Downstream aggregators get wrong sizing.
- **FP:** Implementation reads only global vault state (`totalSupply`, `totalAssets`, protocol-wide fee constants).

**156. ERC4626 Round-Trip Profit Extraction**

- **D:** `redeem(deposit(a)) > a` or inverse — rounding errors in both `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` favor the user, yielding net profit per round-trip.
- **FP:** Rounding per EIP-4626: deposit/mint round down (vault-favorable), withdraw/redeem round up (vault-favorable). OZ ERC4626 with `_decimalsOffset()`.

---

**157. Fee-on-Transfer Token Accounting**

- **D:** Deposit records `deposits[user] += amount` then `transferFrom(..., amount)`. Fee-on-transfer tokens cause contract to receive less than recorded.
- **FP:** Balance measured before/after: `uint256 before = token.balanceOf(this); transferFrom(...); received = balanceOf(this) - before;` and `received` used for accounting.

**158. ERC721 Approval Not Cleared in Custom Transfer Override**

- **D:** Custom `transferFrom` override skips `super._transfer()` or `super.transferFrom()`, missing the `delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId]` step. Previous approval persists under new owner.
- **FP:** Override calls `super.transferFrom` or `super._transfer` internally. Or explicitly deletes approval / calls `_approve(address(0), tokenId, owner)`.

**159. Missing chainId / Message Uniqueness in Bridge**

- **D:** Bridge processes messages without `processedMessages[hash]` replay check, `destinationChainId == block.chainid` validation, or source chain ID in hash. Message replayable cross-chain or on same chain.
- **FP:** Unique nonce per sender. Hash of `(sourceChain, destChain, nonce, payload)` stored and checked. Contract address in hash.

**160. lzCompose Sender Impersonation (Composed Message Spoofing)**

- **D:** `lzCompose` implementation does not validate `msg.sender == endpoint` or does not check the `_from` parameter against the expected OFT address. Attacker calls `lzCompose` directly or via nested compose messages where sender context degrades to `address(this)`, impersonating the OFT contract.
- **FP:** `require(msg.sender == address(endpoint))` and `require(_from == expectedOFT)` validated. No nested compose message support. Standard `OAppReceiver` modifier used. Ref: Tapioca USDO/TOFT exploit (HIGH severity).

**161. Re-initialization Attack**

- **D:** V2 uses `initializer` instead of `reinitializer(2)`. Or upgrade resets initialized counter / storage-collides bool to false. Ref: AllianceBlock (2024).
- **FP:** `reinitializer(version)` with correctly incrementing versions for V2+. Tests verify `initialize()` reverts after first call.

**162. Accrued Interest Omitted from Health Factor or LTV Calculation**

- **D:** Health factor or LTV computed from principal debt without adding accrued interest: `health = collateral / principal` instead of `collateral / (principal + accruedInterest)`. Understates actual debt, delays necessary liquidations.
- **FP:** `getDebt()` includes accrued interest. Interest accrual function called before health check. Interest compounded on every state-changing interaction.

**163. ERC1155 ID-Based Role Access Control With Publicly Mintable Role Tokens**

- **D:** Access control via `require(balanceOf(msg.sender, ROLE_ID) > 0)` where `mint` for those IDs is not separately gated. Role tokens transferable by default.
- **FP:** Minting role-token IDs gated behind separate access control. Role tokens non-transferable (`_beforeTokenTransfer` reverts for non-mint/burn). Dedicated non-token ACL used.

**164. Storage Layout Shift on Upgrade**

- **D:** V2 inserts new state variable in middle of contract instead of appending. Subsequent variables shift slots, corrupting state. Also: changing variable type between versions shifts slot boundaries.
- **FP:** New variables only appended. OZ storage layout validation in CI. Variable types unchanged between versions.

**165. Arbitrary `delegatecall` in Implementation**

- **D:** Implementation exposes `delegatecall` to user-supplied address without restriction. Pattern: `target.delegatecall(data)` where `target` is caller-controlled. Ref: Furucombo (2021).
- **FP:** Target is hardcoded immutable address. Whitelist of approved targets enforced. `call` used instead.

**166. Integer Overflow / Underflow**

- **D:** Arithmetic in `unchecked {}` (>=0.8) without prior bounds check: subtraction without `require(amount <= balance)`, large multiplications. Any arithmetic in <0.8 without SafeMath.
- **FP:** Range provably bounded by earlier checks in same function. `unchecked` only for `++i` loop increments where `i < arr.length`.

---

**167. Rounding in Favor of the User**

- **D:** `shares = assets / pricePerShare` rounds down for deposit but up for redeem. Division without explicit rounding direction. First-depositor donation amplifies the error.
- **FP:** `Math.mulDiv` with explicit `Rounding.Up` where vault-favorable. OZ ERC4626 `_decimalsOffset()`. Dead shares at init.

**168. validateUserOp Missing EntryPoint Caller Restriction**

- **D:** `validateUserOp` is `public`/`external` without `require(msg.sender == entryPoint)`. Also check `execute`/`executeBatch` for same restriction.
- **FP:** `require(msg.sender == address(_entryPoint))` or `onlyEntryPoint` modifier present. Internal visibility used.

**169. Merkle Tree Second Preimage Attack**

- **D:** `MerkleProof.verify(proof, root, leaf)` where leaf derived from user input without double-hashing or type-prefixing. 64-byte input (two sibling hashes) passes as intermediate node.
- **FP:** Leaves double-hashed or include type prefix. Input length enforced != 64 bytes. OZ MerkleProof >= v4.9.2 with sorted-pair variant.

**170. Calldataload / Calldatacopy Out-of-Bounds Read**

- **D:** `calldataload(offset)` where `offset` is user-controlled or exceeds actual calldata length. Reading past `calldatasize()` returns zero-padded bytes silently (no revert), producing phantom zero values that pass downstream logic as valid inputs. Pattern: `calldataload(add(4, mul(index, 32)))` without `require(index < paramCount)`.
- **FP:** `calldatasize()` validated before assembly block (e.g., Solidity ABI decoder already checked). Static offsets into known fixed-length function signatures. Explicit `if lt(calldatasize(), minExpected) { revert(0,0) }` guard.
